- It includes pairs of different brackets such as `«»`, `„“`, `“”`, and `‘’`.
- Special symbols like `©`, `®`, and `™` are also available.
- The degree symbol `°` allows you to write temperatures like `+24°C`.
- Math symbols such as `1¹+2²+3³≠30`, `¹⁄₂+¹⁄₃+¹⁄₄≈1`, and `2×2=4` are easily accessible.
- You can type symbols of currencies like `₴`, `£`, `¥`, `€`, `$`, and `¢` with ease.

### `⌥ option`

Additionally, by using `⌥`, you can input Russian and Belarusian Cyrillic symbols:

* `⌥` + `і` = `ы`
* `⌥` + `е` = `ё`
* `⌥` + `є` = `э`
* `⌥` + `ь` = `ъ`
* `⌥` + `у` = `ў`

### `⌥ option` + `⇧ shift`

With `⌥` + `⇧` and accents, graves, and other symbols, you can type a lot of Slavic letters:

* `⌥` + `⇧` + `¨` than `а` = `ä`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `¨` than `ж` = `ӝ`

When you select special symbols, you enter "dead key" mode, allowing you to choose from a limited set of symbols that support this special function. For instance, if you type `⌥` + `⇧` + `¨` for diaeresis:

Several Slavic letters are hidden, use  `⌥` + `⇧` + `К` "dead key" to access it:
